              | Preferring a little more freedom to travel, I took what I had learnt at VLT Labs and applied it to working with my own clients on an independent basis, affording me time to get a deeper understanding of each product and to push concepts further. I became well-practised at managing feature prioritisation, timelines and delivery. During less busy periods I was able to spend more time on side-projects and learn new techniques in the fast-moving front-end environment.

            p At VLT Labs I became fully immersed in the South-East Asian startup environment, personally working with 5 startups at different stages of maturity. This was a client-facing design (research, ux/ui) and front-end position. I became more practised at presenting my approaches to stakeholders and communicating the thought behind decisions. This was very stimulating and rewarding work and I learnt a great deal about process, tooling and workflow.

              | I left e3 with the title of ‘Interaction Designer’, a new role created for me to better encompass the range of work I had been creating — be it UI, OLA, code-based animation and FMV motion graphics. My comfort with the development (SVN) workflow meant I was able to greatly speed up the turnaround for each project. It was at e3 that I realised being at in the intersection of design and development disciplines within a team could be hugely benfeicial.
