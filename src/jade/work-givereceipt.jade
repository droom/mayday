          p A new goods and services tax (GST) in Malaysia brought about a change in the market, affecting small business owners in particular. It became required by law to issue receipts with every purchase. Heavy accounting software would not be suitable for the majority of small traders and GiveReceipt sought to plug that gap.

          h3 Creating an identity
          p Professional accounting software is usually very staid. GiveReceipt aims to be more accessible, especially for small sole-traders. The name itself is comparatively informal, and we visuals that worked alongside that.

The primary lockup worked well in conventional settings but I know it wouldn’t translate to settings where a full-bleed arrangement wasn’t possible. Ideal usage (L): ‘Give Receipt’ would fit snuggly in the space above. Alternate usage (R).
