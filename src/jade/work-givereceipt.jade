        p April 2015: The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Malaysia brought about a change in retailing, making it a legal requirement to issue receipts with every purchase. Larger retailers would whether the change just fine, but small business with little formal procedures would be particularly affected. Heavy accounting software would not be suitable for these small traders and GiveReceipt sought to arrive in time to plug that gap.

        h3 Creating an identity
        p Professional accounting software is usually very staid. GiveReceipt aims to be more accessible, especially for small sole-traders. The name itself is comparatively informal, and we visuals that worked alongside that. 
        
        p If we were to pare a physical POS ribbon receipt down to its essence, we’d have a few ingredients: its form factor, the perforated edge caused my the blade, the light GSM of the stock. The perforation and aspect is something we could take forward as the basis for the identity. We're still dealing with money so the bright teal is grounded with sensible dark grey/white.

The primary lockup worked well in conventional settings but I know it wouldn’t translate to settings where a full-bleed arrangement wasn’t possible. Ideal usage (L): ‘Give Receipt’ would fit snuggly in the space above. Alternate usage (R).
