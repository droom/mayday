        h2(itemprop="description") GoGet is a community-focused errands and delivery marketplace, starting life in the founders’ hometown of Kuala Lumpur and recently expanding to Hong Kong.

        p GoGet began in 2014, with the aim of matching  those with complementary resources. This exchange between equals, within a safe platform, is what the team at GoGet strive to build. They were already up and running with an MVP when we met in early 2015 and I was tasked with furthering both the brand and the service. My involvement with GoGet could be broken down into three parts: Identity, Product (webapp), and the public facing website.

        h3 Identity
        p Up until this point, GoGet were  working with a logo they had drawn up internally. As both founders readily admitted, neither have design leanings and this simply just a stop-gap. In my opinion, there were three problems with the existing identity: the wordmark didn’t convey the product, the constituent parts weren’t unified and the colours didn’t compliment each other too well.

        p 
          = "As " 
          a(href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL1_xwe8x0c").inline.glide-slow Francesca explains to Bloomberg.tv
          sup
          = ", GoGet is more ‘logistics and human resource’ than straight-up tech. After the first meeting it was clear that ‘speed’ and ‘dispatch’ needed to be primarily communicated in the new identity."


        h3
          = "A " 
          span.entity.accent &rarr;
          = " B"

        p When driving around (or rather being driven around) KL, I had always been drawn to the markings I’d seen on the side HGV’s hauling materials around the city, taking photographs of them as I do with other bits of interesting type. I hit upon the idea of using these to inform the new identity.

        p A note about changing brand colours: When possible, I would attempt  to carry brand colours thorough a refresh.  More than any other ingredient,  colours build equity and recognition, and are the most jarring change to get used to (think hunting for the Foursqaure icon after their refresh). In this case, the change was justified,  even crucial. Being a compound of regular English words, it’s perhaps not surprising that there’s another company operating under the same name: a car sharing service in Australia. They were using this same blue/orange palette and although the two companies aren’t stepping on each others’ toes (in function or proximity), the close ties of the two countries meant we needed to be a distinct as possible visually.

          p We decided there were two separate user journeys, GoGetter (‘I run errands’) and Poster (‘I need someone to run an errand’) with the ability for the user to switch between the two. These distinct use cases offered us two well defined personas to work with. As we only had 3 months with GoGet, we had to hone in on one journey per persona: Create a job + Claim a job.

        h3 Prototyping
        p When sketching  out possible UI components, I figured the multiple windows could be whittled down into one view, with the most common options preselected. The best way to communicate this was to use paper prototypes. These were great at getting the point across without spending too much time crafting things that might not be taken forward. This time, the reimagined flow was accepted so I pushed on into high fidelity.

        h3 Public face

        p As I mentioned earlier, our time with GoGet only lasted 3 months and there was only a certain amount we could accomplish in that time. With the know-how and expertise of a team, it made sense to tackle the most pressing and complex problems first. This meant not talking the public facing /onboarding pages this time.

        p Fast-forward to 2016 and I was back in England and more experienced in service design. I still wanted to takle those pages as it wasn’t reflecting well on anyone involved. Fortunately, Fran and Fung were willing to take some time out to entertain this. The following colloaboration was conducted over Skype with theer marketing team.
