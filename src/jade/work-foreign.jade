        p Revisiting the source for this 4 years later makes me appreciate (even more) how useful all the build tools we now have are. Back then, I was writing vanilla CSS, manually typing out vendor-prefixes, meticulously indenting and then minifying with some online service. Ridiculous. But at least it kept me from writing.
