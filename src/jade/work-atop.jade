        h3 A campaign site for Taiwanese watch manufacturer ATOP.
        p Before I discovered the joys of MacBooks, I used to put together my own Windows builds because I am a huge dweeb. A key component of any PC is its motherboard. This is like the central nevous system of a computer and therefore one of its most important parts. A trusted name in mid-level motherboards at the time was ASUS, a manufacturer from Taiwan. This is all I knew about Taiwan until I came across these watches.

        h3 SVG
        p In 2010, there was a lot of hype around SVG, primarily because of retina screens. Here we had an image format that could. We had a list of watches  12 in total–we needed a way to keep track of them and extend if necessary. The most straight forward to keep track of all this data was to bung it in a JSON object.
